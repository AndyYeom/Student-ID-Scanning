# Student-ID-Scanning
## CMM Computer Vision Project

The Student-ID-Scanner project is designed to automate the process of scanning and recognizing student IDs using computer vision techniques. This repository contains the Jupyter notebook `CMM_CV_FINAL.ipynb`, which demonstrates the application of these techniques.

## Project Overview

This project aims to simplify the identification process in educational institutions by automating student ID scanning. The notebook `CMM_CV_FINAL.ipynb` includes detailed steps and code for processing images, detecting ID cards, and extracting relevant information using optical character recognition (OCR).

## Features

- **ID Detection**: Detect and isolate the ID card from a given image.
- **Text Recognition**: Extract text from the ID card using OCR technologies.
- **Data Processing**: Clean and format extracted data for further use.

## Installation

To run this notebook locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Dependencies

Install all required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python pytesseract
```

### Clone this Repository

```bash
